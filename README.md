# **Bayesian Data Analysis**

## üìå Overview  
This project explores the application of **Bayesian Logistic Regression** to analyze the progression of **liver cirrhosis**, a chronic liver disease. Using a dataset from **Kaggle**, the study examines how **clinical, demographic, and laboratory factors** influence survival outcomes. The analysis applies **Bayesian statistical methods** to enhance model interpretability and quantify uncertainty in predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  
- **Real-World Dataset**: Analyzed the "Cirrhosis Patient Survival Prediction" dataset with **418 observations** and **17 clinical attributes**.  
- **Bayesian Logistic Regression Models**: Implemented **three models** with different **prior specifications** and group-level effects.  
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Performed **one-hot encoding, standardization**, and created new features using **domain knowledge**.  
- **Exploratory & Statistical Analysis**: Used **violin plots, correlation matrices**, and **posterior inference** for better insights.  
- **Model Evaluation & Comparison**: Applied **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV)** to assess model accuracy and generalizability.  
- **Sensitivity & Specificity Analysis**: Evaluated model performance using **true positive and true negative rates**.  
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Augmented dataset size using **synthetic data** to improve model robustness.  
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Conducted **MCMC trace plots, convergence checks, and posterior sampling** for model validation.  

## üìä Methodology  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- Loaded the **cirrhosis dataset** from Kaggle and **handled missing values**.  
- Engineered new features such as **liver function index, symptom score, and age groups**.  
- Standardized numerical variables and applied **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables.  
- Generated **synthetic data** (5,000 samples) to mitigate **class imbalance**.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Bayesian Logistic Regression Models**  
- **Model 1**: Included **random effects for Age Group, Stage, and Symptom Score** with informative priors.  
- **Model 2**: Used **non-informative priors** and adjusted hyperparameters for model flexibility.  
- **Model 3**: Excluded **group-level effects**, focusing on fixed effects only.  
- Applied **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** sampling with **NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler)**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Comparison & Diagnostics**  
- Used **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV)** for predictive performance comparison.  
- Evaluated **sensitivity, specificity**, and **predictive accuracy** on test data.  
- Analyzed **MCMC trace plots, convergence metrics (Rhat), and effective sample size (ESS)**.
